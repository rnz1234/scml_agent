This code is free to use or update given that proper attribution is given to

This module implements a factory manager for the SCM 2021 league of ANAC 2021
competition (one-shot track).
Game Description is available at:
http://www.yasserm.com/scml/scml2021oneshot.pdf

Your agent can sense and act in the world by calling methods in the AWI it has.
For all properties/methods available only to SCM agents check:
  http://www.yasserm.com/scml/scml2020docs/api/scml.oneshot.OneShotAWI.html

Documentation, tutorials and other goodies are available at:
  http://www.yasserm.com/scml/scml2020docs/

Competition website is: https://scml.cs.brown.edu

To test this template do the following:

0. Let the path to this file be /{path-to-this-file}/myagent.py

1. Install a venv (recommended)
>> python3 -m venv .venv

2. Activate the venv (required if you installed a venv)
On Linux/Mac:
    >> source .venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
    >> \.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

3. Update pip just in case (recommended)

>> pip install -U pip wheel

4. Install SCML

>> pip install scml

5. [Optional] Install last year's agents for STD/COLLUSION tracks only

>> pip install scml-agents

6. Run the script with no parameters (assuming you are )

>> python /{path-to-this-file}/myagent.py

You should see a short tournament running and results reported.

    **Not needed for submission.** You can use this function to test your agent.

    Args:
        competition: The competition type to run (possibilities are oneshot, std,
                     collusion).
        n_steps:     The number of simulation steps.
        n_configs:   Number of different world configurations to try.
                     Different world configurations will correspond to
                     different number of factories, profiles

    Returns:
        None

    Remarks:

        - This function will take several minutes to run.
        - To speed it up, use a smaller `n_step` value
